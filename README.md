# master-pipeline-init
Master Pipeline is made to automate the initial setup process for Mulesoft projects in Azure DevOps. This pipeline eliminates the need for manual repo setup and configuration by automating:

✅ Repository Creation – No more manually setting up new repos.
✅ Branch Creation – Automatically creates dev, qa, and prod branches.
✅ Variable Group Setup – Centralized configuration for all environments.
✅ Pipeline Configuration – Auto-generates pipelines using YAML.
✅ Pushing Common Templates – Ensures every project starts with best practices.

By leveraging Bash scripts and Azure DevOps REST APIs, this solution significantly reduces setup time and ensures consistency across projects. One click, and the entire project is ready to go!
